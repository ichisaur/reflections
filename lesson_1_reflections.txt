a diff between two versions of a file lets me see what errors and changes
occured between those two versions of the file.

having access to the entire working history of the file lets you see what changes were 
being made to fix the problems and the course it has had on the function of the
document in general. 

The changes you make are more logical when you save the commits yourself. When
google docs saves the new versions, many times lines are cut off or the version
doesn't actually fix anything.

Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because a lot of the time those 
files are interconnected while other systems like gdocs arent interconnected.

git log shows a log of all the changes and git diff shows all the actual cahnges

Version control lets me break anything I want cause if I do, I just go back and
find the version that broke it and fix it.
