Initializing a repository creates  new git repository that I can use to make git files. It basically turns any folder into a nice little git repository. Also: Holy shit is sublime text good
When we initialize a repository basically a bunch of happiness gets brought into the world

THe staging area is where we set files to e added, the working directory is where we are currently working and the repository is where the git thingy is. 

you can use the staging area to only add in the files that need to be commited for one commit even though you may have made many changes before commiting the new changes

Branches can help us keep our histories organized by allowing us to experiment on different parts of code without completely mucking up the rest of our code. 

Diagrams help us visualize branch structure because it is a flipping branch structure. 

The result of merging branches together is that it merges all the code to the branches into one file. 

Automatic merging is faster, but manual merging is a lot more accurate
