Initializing a repository creates  new git repository that I can use to make git files. It basically turns any folder into a nice little git repository. Also: Holy shit is sublime text good
When we initialize a repository basically a bunch of happiness gets brought into the world

THe staging area is where we set files to e added, the working directory is where we are currently working and the repository is where the git thingy is. 

you can use the staging area to only add in the files that need to be commited for one commit even though you may have made many changes before commiting the new changes
